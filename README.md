# üìù Write It Down

Write It Down is a simple note-taking site.

## Tools

This site was made with the following:

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Prisma (for databases)
- NextAuth (for authentication)
- Framer Motion (for animations)

## Purpose

I wanted to further my experience with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. I also wanted to learn how to use NextAuth for authentication, Prisma for database management, and Framer Motion for animations.
